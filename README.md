# Energiser Score Tracker

For this one day project, Will Edwards and I worked together on producing a score tracker as our first ever full stack app.

We were given the requirements of:

- Must use a Database for persistent storage
- Must use the model pattern to allow easy interaction with the data
- Must use an REST API server to manage requests and serve back data
- Must have a front end which allows users to at least view the data

## Stretch Goals

- Deploy and fix CORS errors.
- CSS Styling needs to be amended.
- Refactor and commenting in code.
